# Representation Engineering

Experiments with representation engineering. There's been a bunch of recent work ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10248), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827)) into using a neural network's latent representations to control & interpret models.

This repository contains utilities for running experiments (the `repeng` package) and a bunch of experiments (the notebooks in `experiments`).
